= Kubernetes Getting Started

== As part of this initial four part series we will accomplish a few key goals:

. *Setup Local Development Environment* Provision and install a local Kubernetes cluster on a mac via homebrew, intended for use as a local development environment for developers to initially gain familiarity with the base Kubernetes constructs. As the developer matures the local environment can be used to develop and test functionality release in the latest branches of the main Kubernetes project.

. *Kubernetes Basic Commands* Familiarize ourselves with the kubectl cli tool and basic Kubernetes commands. We will first deploy a basic nginx pod and execute some commands to help developers gain comfort with the Kubernetes environment from an end-user perspective. This helps gets developers up and running taking advantage of the Kubernetes application deployment capabilities without having to worry about the infrastructure related complexities.

. *Production Ready Cluster* Deploy a 'production-ready' cluster on AWS with KOPS

. *Build on Basics of Kubernetes CLI* Explore additional developer functionality with core Kubernetes constructs such as ReplicaSets, Services, Deployments and DaemonSets.

=== Lets get started with our first goal of getting a local development environment up and running on a mac

We are going to use homebrew to simplify the installation of related software needed to get a Kubernetes developement environment setup on the OSX operating system.

. Install Homebrew and Cask:

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

details are available here:

https://brew.sh/

. Install virtualbox:

    brew cask install virtualbox

. Install minikube:

    brew cask install minikube

. Install kubectl:

    brew cask install kuberenetes-cli

. Start minikube - we are using the VirtualBox driver which is the default selection for minikube, if you would like you can use an alternate supported component (xhyve driver or VMware Fusion) using the ```--vm-driver=xxx``` flag. For this walkthrough with VirtualBox use:

    minikube start


.. This will deploy a local Kubernetes 1.7.0 cluster that you can interact with to start developing and testing your application against. If you see the following output you should be good to go:


.. image:images/startMiniKube.png[startMiniKube]

. Check the status of minikube to get the status of your local Kubernetes cluster:

    minikube status

.. If your output looks like below, everything should be ready to start working with:

.. image:images/statusMiniKube.png[statusMiniKube]

. Here we will execute some basic kubectl cli commands to familiarize ourselves with the cli tool:

.. This command will show all of the nodes available in your kubernetes cluster:

    kubectl get nodes

.. This command shows all of the pods that are deployed into your cluster (into the default namespace), initially this will not show anything:

    kubectl get pods

.. This command, similar to the one above will show all of the pods in the kube-system namespace:

    kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system

. *Create Pod* The following commands will deploy an nginx pod and perform some basic queries into the cluster:

.. This command creates the actual pod:

    kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

.. Check for running pods in your cluster:

    kubectl get pods

.. You see more details by running this command, replace the podxxx with the name of a pod from the above output:

    kubectl describe pod podxxx
