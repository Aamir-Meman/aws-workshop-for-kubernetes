= Using Linkerd with Kubernetes

https://linkerd.io/[Linkerd] adds visibility, control, and reliability to your application with
a wide array of powerful techniques: circuit-breaking, latency-aware load balancing, eventually
consistent (“advisory”) service discovery, deadline propagation, and tracing and instrumentation.

In this exercise, we will focus on visibility for your services running on k8s cluster. We will
install linkerd in your k8s cluster, run couple of simple microservices and demonstrate how
linkerd captures top-line service metrics such as success rates, request volumes and latencies.

== Create kubernetes cluster

Review steps to create k8s cluster from
link:../cluster-install/README.adoc#create-kubernetes-cluster[cluster install] documentation. Validate the cluster and go to next step.

  kops validate cluster

== Install linkerd

Install linkerd using `kubectl`. This will install linkerd as a DaemonSet (i.e., one instance per
host) running in the default kubernetes namespace

  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linkerd/linkerd-examples/master/\
  k8s-daemonset/k8s/linkerd.yml
  configmap "l5d-config" created
  daemonset "l5d" created
  service "l5d" created

  kubectl get all
  NAME           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  po/l5d-f9bwg   2/2       Running   0          4m
  po/l5d-ss4ht   2/2       Running   0          4m
  NAME             CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)                                        AGE
  svc/kubernetes   100.64.0.1       <none>             443/TCP                                        7m
  svc/l5d          100.66.111.236   a3e9a7e509fd3...   4140:31737/TCP,4141:30084/TCP,9990:31699/TCP   4m

You can go to linkerd's admin page (i.e ELB:9990) to verify installation

  LINKERD_ELB=$(kubectl get svc l5d -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].*}")
  echo $LINKERD_ELB

== Install sample microservices apps

The https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd-examples/tree/master/k8s-daemonset/k8s[Github repo for
linkerd examples] has two microservices apps called "hello" and "world". They both communicate
with each other to complete the request. Run this command to install these apps in default
namespace.

  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linkerd/linkerd-examples/master/k8s-daemonset/\
  k8s/hello-world.yml
  replicationcontroller "hello" created
  service "hello" created
  replicationcontroller "world-v1" created
  service "world-v1" created

Generate some traffic by running this command and linkerd will show the number of requests being
served, connections and bunch of rich data

  http_proxy=$LINKERD_ELB:4140 curl -s http://hello

== Install linkerd-viz

linkerd-viz is a monitoring application based on https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] and
http://grafana.org/[Graphana]. It can automatically find linkerd instances and services
that are installed in your k8s cluster.

  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linkerd/linkerd-viz/master/k8s/linkerd-viz.yml
  replicationcontroller "linkerd-viz" created
  service "linkerd-viz" created

You can open linkerd-viz ELB to view the dashboard

  LINKERD_VIZ_ELB=$(kubectl get svc linkerd-viz -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].*}")
  echo $LINKERD_VIZ_ELB

That's it! You can look into linkerd configuration files in https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd-examples/tree/master/k8s-daemonset/k8s[linkerd examples]
to learn more.

== Cleanup

You can review the steps to cleanup from link:../cluster-install/README.adoc#_delete_cluster[delete cluster]
documentation.
