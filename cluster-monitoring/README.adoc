== Kubernetes - Cluster Logging

In this tutorial we will demonstrate two main mechanisms for monitoring Kubernetes clusters:

Using the cAdvisor, Heapster, influx DB and Grafana stack

Using Prometheus with Grafana for visualizations

=== Heapster

Each node in a Kubernetes cluster has cAdvisor which is deployed as part of the main node agent, kubelet, which is accessible on port 4194 (default).

To observe this make sure the proper AWS security groups are in place that allow you access to port 4194, and take a look at one the public ip addresses
