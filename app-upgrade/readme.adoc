This chapter explains different ways by which an application deployed in a Kubernetes cluster can be upgraded.

- Kubectl CLI
- Deployment
- Helm

The application is upgraded from using the image `arungupta/app-upgrade:v1` to using the image `arungupta/app-upgrade:v2`. The v1 image prints "`Hello World!`". The v2 image prints "`Howdy World!`". The source code for these images is in the link:images[] directory.

== Pre-requisites

A 3 master nodes and 5 worker nodes cluster as explained at link:../cluster-install##multi-master-multi-node-multi-az-gossip-based-cluster[] is used for this chapter. A smaller cluster may be used.

All configuration files for this chapter are in the `app-upgrade` directory.
