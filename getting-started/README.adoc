Kubernetes cluster can be created on your laptop, VM, cloud provider or a rack of bare metal servers. For development purpose, its easiest to start with a one-node cluster using https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube]. Hosted solutions or cloud-based solutions provide the scalability and higher availability for production purpose. A complete list of solutions to create Kubernetes cluster is explained at http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/.

This section will explain how to create and shutdown a development Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. The deployment of such an application typically happens on a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). A common way to start a highly available cluster using https://github.com/kubernetes/kops[Kops] on AWS is explained in link:../cluster-install[].

== Setup local development environment

Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop. This allows users to try out Kubernetes on your local machine easily. Minikube packages and configures a Linux VM, the container runtime, and all Kubernetes components, optimized for local development.

=== Setup on Mac OSX

Provision and install a local Kubernetes cluster on a Mac OS via https://brew.sh/[homebrew].

==== Install homebrew and cask

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

==== Install VirtualBox

    brew cask install virtualbox

==== Install minikube

    brew cask install minikube

==== Install Kubectl CLI

    brew install kubernetes-cli

=== Setup on Windows

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.goo\
    gleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl

=== Start minikube

We are using the VirtualBox driver which is the default selection for minikube, if you would like you can use an alternate supported component (xhyve driver or VMware Fusion) using the `--vm-driver=xxx` flag. For this walkthrough with VirtualBox use:

    minikube start

This will deploy a local single-node Kubernetes cluster that you can interact with to start developing and testing your application. If you see the following output, then you should be good to go:

image::start-minikube.png[startMiniKube]

=== Check status

Check the status of minikube to get the status of your local Kubernetes cluster:

    minikube status

If your output looks like below, everything should be ready to start working with:

image::status-minikube.png[statusMiniKube]

== Kubernetes basic commands

In this part we will familiarize ourselves with the `kubectl` CLI tool and basic Kubernetes commands. We will first deploy a basic nginx pod and execute some commands to help developers gain comfort with the Kubernetes environment from an end-user perspective. This helps gets developers up and running taking advantage of the Kubernetes application deployment capabilities without having to worry about the infrastructure related complexities.

Now that we have a local cluster up and running we can start issuing some basic commands and deploy some simple resources.

NOTE: The kubectl commands below will be routed via your virtualbox network interface. If you are using a VPN or have a local firewall, this may prevent kubectl from contacting the minikube endpoint. Stopping the VPN or adding a firewall rule may resolve this.

=== Display nodes

This command will show all the nodes available in your kubernetes cluster:

    kubectl get nodes

=== Create your first pod

This command creates an nginx pod into your cluster:

    kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

Check for running pods in your cluster:

    kubectl get pods

Get additional details for the pod by using the `<pod-name>` from the above output:

    kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

By default, pods are created a in a `default` namespace. In additiopn, a `kube-system` namespace is also reserved for Kubernetes system pods. A list of all the pods in `kube-system` namespace can be displayed as shown:

    kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system

=== Get logs from the pod

Logs from the pod can be obtained:

    kubectl logs <pod-name>

=== Execute a shell on the running pod

This command will open a TTY to a shell in your pod:

    kubectl get pods
    kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash

=== Expose pod

By default, all Kubernetes resources are only accessible within the cluster. This command will publish the NGINX pod to a port on the host where its deployed:

    kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --type=NodePort --name=demo

Where `<pod-name>` is the pod name of your NGINX pod. This will expose the pod as a Service. You can see the published service:

    kubectl get svc

=== View service webpage

This minukube command will display the service for you in a web page:

    minkube service demo

As you will notice it opened a browser with an IP address and the port that the service was exposed on, this is a nice feature of minukube. But what if you wanted to find this information yourself?

You can view the IP address of a node in your cluser with these steps, first find all of the nodes in your cluster:

    kubectl get nodes

Once you have the nodes (in minikubes case there will be only one), we can describe all of the attribute of that node with:

    kubectl describe node <node-name>

Where `<node-name>` is the output from the previous command. This shows alot of information we are not interested in. Instead just grep for the external IP address:

    kubectl describe node node-xxx | grep InternalIP

Great, now we have the IP address for the node. Now, we need to get the port that the service is exposed on. We can retrieve that with:

    kubectl describe service demo

Under the section 'NodePort' you will see which port on the node the service is deployed. So now you have both the IP address and the port and you can either curl that or open it up in a browser

=== Kubernetes dashboard

Kubernetes dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It provides an overview of applications running on the cluster, as well as create or modify individual Kubernetes resources and workloads, such as replica sets, jobs, services, and pods. The dashboard can be used to manage the cluster as well.

Let's install the Kubernetes dashboard:

    minukube dashboard

Browse around and become familiar with some the of kubernetes terminology which we will dig into deeper in the following tutorials.

Let's create a Kubernetes cluster as explained in link:../cluster-install[Install Kubernetes cluster using Kops].
