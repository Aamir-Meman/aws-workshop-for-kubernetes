= Upgrading Kubernetes cluster on AWS using blue/green method

Upgrading cluster using blue/green method takes High Availability for your application into
consideration. There are two approaches of implementing blue/green method and we will describe
these below. These are high level steps and are applicable to stateless applications. Careful
considerations are to be made for each application by testing these approaches before implementing
it in production.

== Blue/Green using ALB Ingress controller
In this approach we will highlight how to use ALB Ingress controller to shift traffic from blue
cluster to green cluster.

== Blue/Green using Route53 weighted round robin
In this approach we will go through the steps of using Route53's weighted round robin feature
to shift the traffic from blue cluster to green cluster.
