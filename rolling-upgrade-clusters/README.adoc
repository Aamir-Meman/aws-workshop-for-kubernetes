= Upgrading Kubernetes cluster on AWS

Upgrading Kubernetes cluster on AWS is easy with kops. In this exercise we will setup k8s cluster with
1.6.10 version and perform rolling upgrade to 1.7.5 which at the time were major versions

. Create Cluster

  # review steps to create prereqs (S3 bucket, Route53 hosted zone) from [link to install cluster
  [install-cluster]] documentation
  # create cluster using following command
  kops create cluster --dns private --name mycluster.k8s-aws.internal --zones us-east-1a,\
  us-east-1b --state s3://dalbhanj-kubernetes-aws-io --vpc $VPCID --network-cidr 10.1.0.0/16\
  --ssh-public-key $mypubkey --kubernetes-version=1.6.10
  # edit cluster configuration if necessary
  kops edit cluster mycluster.k8s-aws.internal
  # update configuration and apply changes
  kops update cluster mycluster.k8s-aws.internal --yes

. Upgrade Cluster
