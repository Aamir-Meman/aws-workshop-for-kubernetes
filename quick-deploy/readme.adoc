= Create Kubernetes cluster using CloudFormation and Terraform

This chapter explains how to create a Kubernetes cluster using CloudFormation and Terraform.

== CloudFormation

https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation] gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

A CloudFormation template is available in the link:cloudformation[] directory.

Create a Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

	cd quickdeploy
	aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name k8s --template-body file://k8s-create-no-alb.yaml
